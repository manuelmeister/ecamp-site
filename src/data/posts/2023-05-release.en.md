Since the last deployment we have mainly focused on fixing minor bugs.
Thanks for the valuable feedback.

- Fixed an error when drawing a new block in the program.
- The error handling of the material list has been improved.
- Blocks that have inactive responsible persons assigned are now displayed in the program and in the activities overview.
- Print layout #2 uses the set language for translation.

We have also received contributions from the community again:
- If you change the name in the profile, the changes will be applied everywhere.
- Forms with invalid content can no longer be submitted.

We are very happy that talented developers take action right away and implement the
improvements themselves.

We are still working on optimizing the printing features for multi-week (summer) camps.
The first version of the progress label feature is also on the way, a feature which was missed
by many.

A lot of people have applied for the beta phase during the summer camp, which is why we are not giving out any new codes for the summer camp.

You can still apply for access codes for later camps with the [Form](https://forms.office.com/e/TRKsfnazf5). We look forward to your feedback!
